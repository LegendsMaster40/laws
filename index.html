        <h2>Copyright Act</h2>

        <h3>What does Copyright Act mean ?</h3>
        <p>Copyright is a legal principle that gives creators exclusive rights to their original works, such as books, music or art. It provides control over how the works are used and protects the interests of the creators.
        </p>

        <h3>How Long Does The Copyright last ?</h3>
        <p>Copyright is limited in time and varies between countries. Exceptions, such as "fair use" or "fair dealing," allow certain uses of works for purposes such as reviews or research.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there any difference in terms of rights between using other people's material for private use and for.</h3>
        <p>There can be differences in rights when using other people's material for private use compared to commercial use. 
            Private use may have more lenient restrictions, often falling under fair use or fair dealing exceptions. 
            Commercial use typically requires obtaining proper permissions or licenses from the copyright owner. 
            The specifics vary by jurisdiction and depend on the nature of the use.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you use (publish, etc.) a picture of another person without their consent?</h3>
        <p>Using or publishing a picture of another person without their consent may infringe on their privacy rights, depending on the jurisdiction. 
            It's important to respect individuals' rights to control the use of their images. In many cases, 
            obtaining explicit consent before using or publishing someone's picture is a legal and ethical practice.
        </p>

        <h3>Explain what is meant by Creative Commons.</h3>
        <p>Creative Commons is a licensing system that allows content creators to specify the permissions for others to use their work. 
            It offers a range of licenses that define the terms under which a work (such as images, music, or text) can be shared, reused, and adapted, 
            while still respecting the creator's rights.
