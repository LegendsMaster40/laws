        <h3>What is a so-called "cake" or "cookie" and what are they used for in a web context?</h3>
        <p>a "cake" or "cookie" refers to a small piece of data stored on a user's device by a web browser. Cookies are used to remember user preferences, login information, 
            and track website activity for purposes such as analytics and personalized content delivery.</p>

        <h3>How Long Does The Copyright last ?</h3>
        <p>In January 2022, specific regulations regarding cookies can vary by country and region. 
            In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) addresses the handling of cookies. 
            It requires websites to obtain user consent before storing cookies on their devices and provides users with the right to manage cookie preferences. 
            For the most up-to-date and accurate information, please refer to the latest legal documents and regulations, as they may have changed since my last update.</p>
